# GitYap: A Minimalist Message-Based Communication Platform

## Overview

GitYap is a lightweight, file-based messaging platform that combines the simplicity of Unix philosophy with modern web technologies. It's designed for developers, researchers, and anyone who appreciates elegant, minimal solutions to complex problems.

### Key Features

- **File-Based Architecture**: Messages are stored as plain text files, enabling easy version control, backup, and analysis
- **Git Integration**: Native support for Git-based message synchronization and distributed deployment
- **Extensible Design**: Modular codebase with clean separation of concerns
- **Language Agnostic**: Core functionality implemented in Python with support for multiple scripting languages
- **Mobile-First UI**: Responsive design with dark mode support
- **Search Capabilities**: Real-time message search with highlighting
- **Threading Support**: Hierarchical message organization with reply functionality

## For Hackers

- Zero external dependencies for core functionality
- Clean, documented codebase with consistent marker comments
- Extensible plugin architecture for custom message processors
- Support for multiple scripting engines (Python, Perl, Ruby, Node.js)
- Built-in development server with auto-reload capabilities
- Automated port discovery and conflict resolution

```python
# Example: Adding a custom message processor
class MyProcessor:
    def process(self, message):
        # Your custom processing logic here
        return processed_message
```

## For Academics

- Ideal platform for studying:
  - Distributed systems
  - Information retrieval
  - Human-computer interaction
  - Natural language processing
  - Software architecture patterns

- Research Applications:
  - Communication pattern analysis
  - Message propagation studies
  - Temporal data mining
  - Social network analysis
  - Linguistic research

## Quick Start

```bash
# Fork this repository to your GitHub account
